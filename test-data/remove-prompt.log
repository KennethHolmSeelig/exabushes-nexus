These are the lands of Silverdell. You are standing on a beautiful green hilltop. Cold air blows across your face as you stand gazing at the expansive view to the north. A sense of excitement rises in your blood, and you get the feeling that many adventures are in store for you in this strange new land. Your eyes trace a dirt road which begins directly at your feet, runs a ways down to the base of the hill, and then travels north toward a small town that is visible in the distance. Right beside the road stands a shimmering blue portal. If you haven't already done so, you might wish to read the sign here.

There is one obvious exit: north.
A tutorial sign (unread) and a shimmering blue portal.

If you wish to skip the tutorial, you may <read explanation> in your tutorial journal for information on how to do so.

Also, remember! Use <ntell> to get help from other players. For example, you could type <ntell I'm new, and lost! Help please?>

A few useful commands to get you started:

 <look> or <l>          - To look around.
 <examine> or <exa>     - Examine an item. Try: <exa me>
 <say Hello>            - Speak to someone.
 <introduce me>         - Introduce yourself to someone.
 <n>, <s>, <e>, <w>     - Go north, south, east or west.
